# Title

- Contribution Name: (what do you want to call your `awesome_feature`?)
- Implementation Owner: (your github @username)
- Start Date: (today's date, dd-mm-yyyy)
- Target Date: (expected date of completion, dd-mm-yyyy)
- Appwrite Issue:
  [Is this RFC inspired by an issue in appwrite](https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/issues/)

## Summary

[summary]: #summary

Brief explanation of the proposed contribution

## Problem Statement (Step 1)

[problem-statement]: #problem-statement

- What problem are you trying to solve?
- What is the context or background in which this problem exists?
- Once the proposal is implemented, how will the system change?

Please avoid discussing your proposed solution.

## Design proposal (Step 2)

[design-proposal]: #design-proposal

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail keeping in mind the following:

- Its interaction with other parts of the system is clear
- It is **reasonably clear how the contribution would be implemented**
- Dependencies on libraries, tools, projects or work that isn't yet complete
- New API routes that need to be created or modifications to the existing routes (if needed)
- Any breaking changes and ways in which we can ensure backward compatibility.
- Use Cases
- Goals
- Deliverables

Ensure that you include examples, code-snippets etc. to allow the community to understand the proposed solution. **It would be best if the examples use naming conventions that you intend to use during the actual implementation so that changes can be suggested early on during the development.**

### Prior art

[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. A
few examples of what this can include are:

- Does this functionality exist in other software and what experience has their
  community had?
- For other teams: What lessons can we learn from what other communities have
  done here?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If
  you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed
  theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the
lessons from other software, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.
If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us
whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other software.

### Unresolved questions

[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process
  before this gets merged?

### Future possibilities

[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you are writing but otherwise related.
